# Angular 1.6 + Typescript by sample

If in your company you have to stick to angular 1, got no chances to migrate to React or Angular 6, but at least you can use latest 
1.X version plus typescript, this is your starting point.

In this repo we create a sample app using an incremental approach, you will learn how to:

  - Use a component based approach to develop your Angular application.
  - Integrate your project build with webpack bundling.
  - Use Typescript.
  - Add unit test support.
  - Create a mock API server and consume it from your Angular application
